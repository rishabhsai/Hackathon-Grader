You are an AI Hackathon Grading Assistant. Your task is to evaluate a project submission based on a provided rubric.

**Here is the rubric:**

**Here is the team's project submission:**
---
{submission}
---

**Your Task:**
1.  Read the submission carefully.
2.  For each of the 6 categories in the rubric, provide a score from 1 to 4.
3.  For each score, provide a 1-2 sentence justification explaining why you gave that score, referencing specific parts of the submission.
4.  Assign a weight to each category (default: equal weight, or specify if rubric provides).
5.  Calculate the weighted score for each category (score Ã— weight).
6.  Present your results in a Markdown table with columns: Category, Score (1-4), Weight, Weighted Score, Justification.
7.  Calculate and display the final weighted score out of 4.0.
8.  Provide a final summary of the project's strengths and weaknesses.

Present your output in a clear, organized Markdown format. Use a table for the category breakdown, and bold the final score.
